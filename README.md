# Mutillidae Terraform

This project contains reference architectures for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure Cloud. Reference architectures provide a working model to demonstrate security best-practices.

The project also contains scripts to generate a deliberately insecure lab environment. The lab environment can be used for demonstrations and in classwork.

## Reference Architectures

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae-terraform/blob/development/reference-architecture/aws/README.md "Google Cloud Platform (GCP)")
- [Microsoft Azure Cloud](https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae-terraform/blob/development/reference-architecture/azure/README.md "Microsoft Azure Cloud")
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae-terraform/blob/main/reference-architecture/gcp/README.md "Google Cloud Platform (GCP)")

## Lab Environments

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) - TODO - Please contribute using a Pull Request
- Microsoft Azure Cloud - TODO - Please contribute using a Pull Request
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae-terraform/blob/main/lab-environment/gcp/README.md "Google Cloud Platform (GCP)")

## Cloud Command Line Interfaces (CLI) used in this project

### The Amazon Web Services (AWS) *aws* client software

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) *aws* CLI client software is only needed for the Reference Architecture, but not the GCP lab.
