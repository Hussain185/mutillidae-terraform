# Mutillidae Terraform

This project contains reference architectures for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure Cloud. Reference architectures provide a working model to demonstrate security best-practices.

The project also contains scripts to generate a deliberately insecure lab environment. The lab environment can be used for demonstrations and in classwork.
